    "> Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are electronic switches where a current flows from the source terminal to the drain terminal, controlled by the voltage applied to the third terminal, the gate. Benchmark models need to reasonably reproduce the current-voltage (IV) characteristics of TFTs with a minimal number of parameters. Here, \"reasonably\" means that the model parameters can be reliably and unambiguously extracted from experimental IV curves."

    "> The ubiquitous computing paradigm envisions computing appearing everywhere at any time. Flexible electronics are considered an essential enabling technology `[1]`. Flexible electronics offer various form factors, including soft, flexible, stretchable, and lightweight forms, thus allowing ambient intelligence to become widely available. Promising applications in health, industrial, environmental, agricultural, and structural monitoring have already been demonstrated `[2]`. It is generally accepted that the low cost required for edge devices `[3]` of future Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructures can only be achieved through printing manufacturing. The basic printed blocks of flexible electronics include sensors, energy harvesters, displays, and antennas. Many of these components require thin-film transistors (TFTs) as active switches. TFTs are usually compared across different devices and technologies based on threshold voltage, charge carrier mobility, and series resistance. However, conventional parameter extraction established for silicon transistors often leads to misleading results when applied to TFTs `[4]`. Some of the peculiarities of TFTs can be addressed by the virtual source (VS) emission-diffusion (ED) theory `[5]`. In combination with nonlinear least squares solvers, VSED-based benchmark models can replace conventional extraction methods and are applicable to a wide range of TFT technologies `[6]`."

    "> The optimization of parameters for TFT devices is an important process in the manufacturing of thin-film electronics. The main reason for performing this process is to improve the performance of the devices, making them more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. Essentially, we want to optimize certain parameters embedded in a model that will provide the best results for the production of these devices. A simplified form of how the model operates can be described as follows: `ID = F(VGS, VDS)` where:\n",
    "> * ID → Electric current that flows between the source and drain terminals of a thin-film transistor (TFT)\n",
    "> * VGS → Voltage applied to the gate terminal of the transistor, which controls the current flowing between the source and drain terminals\n",
    "> * VDS → Voltage applied to the drain terminal of the transistor, which determines the current flowing between the source and drain terminals when the gate voltage is kept constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> VGS and VDS are important for the operation of the TFT transistor and for the optimization of its parameters, which can be obtained from the device's transfer and output curves. From these operations, it is possible to obtain information about its parameters, such as Vtho, l, n, JD, leak, δ, RS, λ, and Vcrit. Since these parameters are limited in the model, it allows for the simultaneous adjustment of all values. Therefore, parameter optimization is performed using a nonlinear least squares solver, which allows for efficient and unambiguous parameter adjustment. In this way, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the TFT device's behavior and optimize its operation for specific applications. Additionally, parameter optimization is also important to ensure the quality and reliability of the device, as well as its integration into complex electronic circuits."

    "> To perform this optimization, we will use the SciPy library, an open-source Python module that provides advanced mathematical functions and algorithms for scientific data processing and numerical analysis. More specifically, we will apply the `curve_fit` function, which is a type of optimization that finds an ideal set of parameters for a defined function that best fits a given set of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unlike supervised learning, curve fitting requires the author to define the function that maps input examples to outputs. The mapping function, also called the base function, can take any form, including a straight line (linear regression), a curved line (polynomial regression), and many others. This provides flexibility and control to define the shape of the curve, where an optimization process is used to find the optimal specific parameters of the function. For our purposes, this will be to optimize the parameters of the function $ID = F(VGS, VDS)$, which will give us the current at each pair of points from the experiment conducted.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> The `x-axis is the independent variable` or the input to the function. The `y-axis is the dependent variable` or the output of the function. We do not know the shape of the function that maps input examples to outputs, but we suspect we can approximate the function with a standard function shape. Curve fitting involves first defining the `functional form of the mapping function` (base function or objective function) and searching for the parameters in the function that result in the minimum error.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The error is calculated using observations from the domain and passing the inputs to our candidate mapping function, calculating the output, and comparing the calculated output with the observed output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once in shape, we can use the mapping function to interpolate or extrapolate new points in the domain. It is common to run a sequence of input values through the mapping function to calculate a sequence of outputs, then create a line graph of the result to show how the output varies with the input and how well the line fits the observed points.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key to curve fitting is the shape of the mapping function. A straight line between inputs and outputs can be defined as follows: `y = a * x + b`\n",
    "Where `y is the calculated output`, `x is the input`, and `a` and `b` are parameters of the mapping function found using an optimization algorithm. This is called a linear equation because it is a weighted sum of the inputs. In a linear regression model, these parameters are referred to as coefficients; in a neural network, they are called weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This equation can be generalized to any number of inputs (which is the purpose for us), meaning that the notion of curve fitting is not limited to two dimensions (one input and one output) but could have many input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An important observation is that adding arbitrary mathematical functions to our mapping function usually means we cannot calculate the parameters analytically and instead need to use an iterative optimization algorithm. This is called `nonlinear least squares`,\n",
    "as the objective function is no longer convex (not linear), and it is not as simple to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since our model's data is bi-dimensional, we are not in the trivial case. Thus, when passing data to the model, we will need to preprocess it first. For instance, suppose that for our problem, we will have the voltages Vd and Vg as a set of vectors. Essentially, what will be computed is an $MxN$ matrix; however, the `curve_fit` function only calculates ideal parameters for the one-dimensional vector case. So, we will first allocate all Vg voltages into a matrix and do the same for Vd voltages. Then, we will use Python's `np.ravel()` function to transform an array into a one-dimensional array. This operation does not affect the integrity of the data, only resizes it. The `np.ravel()` function returns a copy of the original array, with all elements of the original array \"flattened\" into a single one-dimensional array. This means that the function returns an array with all the rows of the original array concatenated into a single row."

    "The drain current of a TFT consists of mobile charges $Q_{free}$ modulated by the gate voltage and moves with a velocity modulated by the drain voltage. At high electric fields from source to drain, the carrier velocity saturates at a value $V_{sat}$. However, carriers need to scale a potential barrier on the path from source to drain, which represents a bottleneck for carrier transport. The limited rate of charge injection from the top of the barrier potential choke point can be termed as a virtual source (VS). The modified $V_{sed}$ model suggests a specific form of drain current per gate width W in VS:\n",

    "Some charged particles are not mobile. In certain cases, an exponential tail of trapping states ranging from the valence band edge to the band gap can relate the free and total carrier density by a power law. This occurs because all states are occupied according to the same quasi-Fermi level, as seen in Equation (B4) in [8] and its earlier derivation. Thus, the equation shows that\n",

    "Here, $σ_V$ and $σ_{traps}$ represent the density of valence states and traps in a single semiconductor layer in $V_S$, respectively. The value of the exponent $l$ is determined by the effective \"temperature\" ratio defining the exponential distribution of trap states' energy and the device temperature, originating from the Boltzmann energy distribution of free charge carriers. However, since the exact trap distribution is generally unknown, $l$ is treated as a model parameter. The distinction between free and trapped charge carriers, as presented in Equation (2), is the main adaptation of the VSED framework for thin film materials proposed in this work.\n",

    "The gate insulator capacitance depends on the dielectric constant ε and the insulator thickness tI: $C_I = \\frac{ε}{t_I}$. The thermal voltage is represented by $V_T = \\frac{kT}{q}$. The transition from weak to strong accumulation is modeled by parameters $n, V_{th0}$, and $δ$, where $n$ is influenced by the charging of the semiconductor region adjacent to the gate insulator interface, filling surface states and affecting the band bending rate with gate bias.\n",

    "The interface potential becomes independent of VGS when it reaches a bias value $ψ \\cdot V_S$, also known as threshold voltage. This allows parameterizing the potential barrier control by gate bias in TFTs. The parameter $ψ \\cdot V_S$ represents the critical bias at which the potential at $V_S$ becomes independent of gate voltage. During hole accumulation at the gate insulator interface, parameters n and $l$ describe the loading of trap states, and the voltage scale for the exponential increase of drain current with gate bias is given by $(\\frac{n}{l}) \\cdot V_T$ in the VSED model.

    "The charge injection velocity $Q_{free}$ in the transistor channel is represented by $V_{inj} = V_{sat} \\cdot F_{sat}$. It is common to estimate the drain current in TFTs as a drift motion of injected charge carriers, but this can lead to a mistaken conclusion about saturation velocity $V_{sat}$. While in high electric field regions the saturation velocity equals the body semiconductor saturation velocity, in low electric field regions the saturation velocity is defined by the unidirectional thermal velocity of the quasi-Fermi potential, not the electrostatic potential. This concept is discussed in [10]:\n",

In low drain bias, charge carrier diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism in much of the TFT and not just in $V_S$. The characteristic length in Eq. (5) will no longer be given by the mean free path $\\bar{\\lambda}_{free}$ but by the diffusion length. Since only carriers of a single type are injected into a basically intrinsic semiconductor, the diffusion length can be very large and comparable to the device dimension given by the gate length $L_G$. $F_{sat}$ introduces a length scale $λ = \\frac{L_G}{\\bar{\\lambda}_{free}}$, which effectively replaces ${\\bar{\\lambda}_{free}}$ → $L_G$ under low drain bias.\n",

(5) is achieved only for both large $V_{SG}$ (low barrier) and large $V_{SD}$ (sink load). In general, the critical diffusion length replacing $\\lambda_{free}$ in Eq.
